  description: |
    This resource describes a dimming function.
    The value is an integer showing the current dimming level.
    The step is the increment between dimmer values.
    The range is the maximum and minimum values for the dimming value.
    If the range is omitted [0,100] is assumed.
    A value of 0 means total dimming; a value of 100 means no dimming.
