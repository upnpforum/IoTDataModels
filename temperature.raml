  description: |
    This resource describes a sensed or actuated Temperature value.
    The temperature describes the current value measured.
    If the units attribute is missing the default is Celsius [C].
    The range is a comma separated min,max values for this temperature on this device.
    If no range is provided the default is +/- MAXINT.

      Retrieves the current temperature value.
      A client can specify the units for the requested temperature by use of a query parameter.

          This response is generated by the OIC Server when the client sends:
            A retrieve with q queryParameter indicating a unit that the server does not support.
          The server responds with the units enumeration illustrating the error.
