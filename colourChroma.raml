    This resource describes the colour using chroma conventions.
    Properties are hue, saturation and colorspacevalue.
    Hue and saturation are integer values as defined by the CIECAM02 model definition.
    Colourspacevalue is a CSV of chromaX, chromaY, colourTemperature (X,Y,T).
    ChromaX and chromaY are defined by CIE.
    ColourTemperature is the Mired color temperature.
