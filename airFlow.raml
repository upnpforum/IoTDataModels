    This resource describes the properties associated with air flow.
    The direction is the directionality of the air flow if applicable.
    Direction values are dependent on the capabilities of the unit.
    The speed is an integer representing the current speed level for the unit.
    The range is the min,max values for the speed level.

          This response is generated by the OIC Server when the client sends:
            An update with an invalid property value for direction.
            An update with an out of range property value for speed.
          The server responds with the current resource representation.
