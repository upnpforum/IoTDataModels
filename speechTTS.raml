    This resource may be created on the OIC Server that is capable of rendering speech by an OIC Client
     or may be created on the OIC Server by some resident application.
    The audio rendered is at this stage local to the Server (i.e. not streamed).
    The utterance is an SSML document.
    The supportedLanguages is a comma separate value list of the RFC 5646 defined language tags that are supported.
